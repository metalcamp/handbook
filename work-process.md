# Work Process

Our work process is based on [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)), but modified slightly to apply better to our specific needs:

 * we don't do customer projects, so we are our own Product Owners,
 * we currently use GitHub and ZenHub for sprint management,
 * we work asynchronously, so we try to keep scheduled meetings to the bare minimum.

Undefined issues are created in various repositories. Support issues, being reactionary, stay in project-related repositories and are not included in sprints. When undefined issues in various repositories are to be moved into a sprint, User Story needs to be created for that issue with well defined Acceptance Criteria and Definition of Done. This can be done by the author of the issue, Scrum Master or Project Owner. Sprint is managed from the [Operations repository](https://github.com/niteoweb/operations/issues).

In Operations repository when you open an issue, it has a template that helps you define the User Story. User Story in this step is labeled with `Needs User Story`, a descriptive label, project label and department label. The Scrum Master and Product Owner verify if the User Story is well defined. If it is not they assign people from whom they want to receive feedback for better definition of the User Story. Once these people post their feedback, they unassign themselves from the User Story. Once the Scrum Master and Product Owner agree that the User Stories well defined, they remove the label `Needs User Story` and label it `Needs Story Points`. At that point, Scrum Master and/or Product Owner assign people from whom they want to receive User Story Points estimation. With this online poker planning begins. At the end of the online poker planning, Story Points are added to the User Story, and `Needs Story Points` label is removed. The User Story is now prepared to be added to the Product Backlog.

Important:

* you are only assigned to a ticket when you need to do something: give feedback, vote on Story Points or are the champion working on the User Story
* unassign yourself when you have done the above task

## Writing User Stories

When you open a new issue in Operations repository, a template will guide you through the process.

Things to be written in the User Story:

**User Story**

"As a ..., I want ..., so that ..."

**Description** 

Write in as much detail as possible, add mockups, previous discussion, etc.

**Definition of Done**

Only remove what is not necessary.

* 100% test coverage.
* Write/Update tech docs: are there any technical docs that need to be written or updated?
* Write/Update support docs: notify support and they will go through the steps of the User Story and write or update the support docs.
* Write/Update Help Center article: notify support and they will go through the steps of the User Story and write or update the Help Center.
* Write/Update Intra/Handbook docs: notify operations and they will go through the steps of the User Story and write or update Handbook or Intra.
* Deployed.

**Acceptance Criteria**

Activities that need to be performed so this user story can be moved to `Done`. Links to PR, tested and working feature, notified support, etc.


## Story Point Estimation

[Story Point](https://agilefaq.wordpress.com/2007/11/13/what-is-a-story-point/) is an arbitrary measure used by Scrum teams to indicate the effort required to implement a User Story. One full time member on sprint should be able to do 10 Story Points. For labeling User Story estimates, we use [ZenHub Estimates](https://www.zenhub.com/blog/software-estimates/).

In the step `Needs Story Points`, Scrum Master assigns the User Story to people from whom s/he wants to receive Story Point estimations. Once these people post their story point estimation, they unassign themselves from the User Story. The Scrum Master then adds the agreed numbered Story Point label to the title, removes the `Needs Story Points` label and adds label `Product Backlog`. This User Story can now be added to Kanban Board Product Backlog for review on next sprint.

## User Story Steps Summary:

1. `Needs User Story` - needs well defined User Story, Scrum Master requests feedback and input from all stakeholders
2. `Needs Story Points` - needs story points estimation, Scrum Master requests input from people with knowledge about the task
3. `Product Backlog` - well-defined User Story that can go in the next sprint

We also have the `Ongoing` label for ongoing tasks. These tasks do not get included in sprints, but we acknowledge them by decreasing our sprint story points limit.


## Urgent Production Fixes

If we need to fix an urgent bug, we use the Scrum Priority Lane approach: the User Story gets written and then if the Product Owner decides it really is urgent, the User Story is added to the top of WIP column and labeled with [Priority Lane](#label_priority_lane) so that everyone knows it is an exceptional and urgent issue and the whole team needs to focus on getting it to column Done ASAP.


## Ongoing Tasks

Sometimes the result of a User Story is an agreement that we should do a certain task periodically, over a longer period of time. Such tasks are created in whichever repo is the most appropriate and labeled with [Ongoing](#label_ongoing) label.


## Issue Labels

Descriptive labels:

 * <a name="label_feature"></a>**Feature**: a user-facing or support-facing improvement, addition
 * <a name="label_cleanup"></a>**Cleanup**: something that increases our velocity
 * <a name="label_bug"></a>**Bug**: a user-facing or support-facing annoyance
 * <a name="label_ongoing"></a>**Ongoing**: long-running tasks, are not in sprints, see [Ongoing Tasks](#ongoing-tasks)
 * <a name="label_sanity_check"></a>**Sanity Check**: Results of automatic checks of production data, more on TODO.

Project labels:

 * <a name="label_ebn"></a>**EBN**: User Stories for the Easy Blog Networks project
 * <a name="label_dmon"></a>**DMON**: User Stories for the Easy Domain Monitor / Indexation Check project

Department labels:

 * <a name="label_operations"></a>**Operations**: operations related task, such as adding and improving internal docs, processes, etc.
 * <a name="label_marketing"></a>**Marketing**: a marketing related task, such as setting up ad campaigns, writing blog posts, etc.
 * <a name="label_support"></a>**Support**: user-facing maintenance work, not included in sprints, such as fixing subscription problems, resetting passwords, re-enabling accounts, etc.
 * <a name="label_people"></a>**People**: internally-facing maintenance work, not included in sprints, such as hiring, onboarding, etc.

Scrum labels:

* <a name="label_needs_user_story"></a>**Needs User Story**: when User Story is first opened, it needs to be defined by all stakeholders
* <a name="label_needs_story_points"></a>**Needs Story Points**: in the process of Story Points voting
* <a name="label_product_backlog"></a>**Product Backlog**: when User Story is defined and has story points, it gets marked for Product Backlog
* <a name="label_priority_lane"></a>**Priority Lane**: User Stories injected into the current sprint due to urgency
* <a name="label_retrospective"></a>**Retrospective**: issues that describe the sprint retrospective

## Sprint Retrospective

After each sprint, we do a retrospective. We think about:

* What went well during the sprint?
* What went wrong during the sprint?
* What could we do differently to improve?
* Other comments.

We also add a note on how many Story Points we assigned, how many were done and the distribution between the departments and types of User Stories.


## Scrum

Sprint length: two weeks.

Story Points commitment: 10 for each full-time member on the sprint and at least 10 for bugfixes and cleanup.

User Stories with the highest story points are assigned and started first. That way simpler User Stories without champions can be worked on in the last days of the sprint by anyone who finished their own early.

User Stories that are dependent on each other should be merged into one bigger user story. This kind of user stories can have 2 champions.

For each sprint, a new milestone is created with name `Sprint #X` where `X` is the number of the sprint (e.g. `Sprint #4`). On SCRUM sprint planning each User Story that is added to the planning sprint must be also added to the new milestone. With this ZenHub will automatically generate Burndown chart and we avoid having an additional label (`Sprint #X` label).


### Schedule

Our sprints start on a Wednesday 10am CEST with the [Sprint Planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint_planning) meeting. They end on a Tuesday two weeks later with [Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint_review_and_retrospective) meetings held at 10am CEST.

On the Wednesday in the middle of the sprint we hold the <a name="product_backlog_refinement_meeting"></a>[Product Backlog Refinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Backlog_refinement) meeting at 10am CEST.

All other days we hold the [Daily Standup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Daily_scrum) meeting at 10am CEST.


### Team Capacity

To have a quick overview of who is available to work in the current sprint we use the following rule:

 * people who are away are not included in the sprint
 * people who are swamped with maintenance, support and ongoing work are not included in the sprint so they can focus on their work
 * people who can commit about half of their time to the sprint work have a "single finger" icon
 * people who can commit most of their time to the sprint work have a "double fingers" icon
